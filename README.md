# Cross-Cirlces
My first game developed using Java Swing.

Game Rules:-
• Player 1 starts with "O"
• Player 2 goes next with "X"
• In order to win, you must have 3 in a row, column or diagonal.
• Undo is allowed only once per turn to prevent cheating.
• Undo cannot be used when a Player has won or draw occurred.
• Play again button is set to visible only when the current game has concluded.


Technical Stuff:-

Add this project to your netbeans/java swing IDE and run it.
Please inform me if you find any bugs.
Work Left: Commenting the code.

There are 11 buttons:-
1-9: Play area for X and O
10: Play Again 
11: Undo

There are 2 labels:
•Header
•Display for Player Turn or Victory Message
