# Cross-Cirlces

My first game developed using Java Swing.

Game Rules:-

• Player 1 starts with "O" <br>
• Player 2 goes next with "X" <br>
• In order to win, you must have 3 in a row, column or diagonal. <br>
• Undo is allowed only once per turn to prevent cheating. <br>
• Undo can be done multiple times. <br>
• Play again button is set to visible only when the current game has concluded. <br>


<h3>Technical Stuff:-</h3>

Add this project to your netbeans/java swing IDE and run it.
Please inform me if you find any bugs.

Work Left: Commenting the code.

There are 11 buttons:-

1-9: Play area for X and O <br>
10: Play Again <br>
11: Undo <br>


There are 2 labels:

•Header <br>
•Display for Player Turn or Victory Message <br>
